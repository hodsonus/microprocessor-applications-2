This is the repository that I used for EEL4930 - Microprocessor Applications 2 at the University of Florida during Spring of 2020. Course coverage included the implementation of a Real-Time Operating System on an ARM Cortex M processor to create more robust and complex microprocessor applications. Introduction to IoT applications and AI implementations on IoT devices.
